Sure! Let’s compare the differences between these three git add commands:

1️⃣ git add .

Adds all changes in the current directory recursively, including:

Modified files

New (untracked) files

New folders and their contents

Very broad; useful when you want to stage everything.

Example:

git add .


Pros: Quick, stages everything.

Cons: May include files you didn’t intend to commit.

2️⃣ git add 07-Language-Go/

Adds all files inside the folder 07-Language-Go recursively, including subfolders.

Does not affect other folders.

Example:

git add 07-Language-Go/


Pros: Targets a specific folder.

Cons: You must repeat for other folders.

3️⃣ git add 07-Language-Go/main.go

Adds only this specific file (main.go).

Does not affect any other files or folders.

Example:

git add 07-Language-Go/main.go


Pros: Very precise; useful if you only want to stage one file.

Cons: Must manually add each file if you have many new files.
