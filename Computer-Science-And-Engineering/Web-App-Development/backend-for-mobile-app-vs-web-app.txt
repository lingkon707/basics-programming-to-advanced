===========================================
   BACKEND FOR MOBILE APP VS WEB APP
===========================================

1. BACKEND BASICS
-----------------
- Backend = Server-side system that processes requests,
  applies logic, connects to database, and returns responses.
- Common Technologies:
  * Node.js, Django, Laravel, Spring Boot, .NET
  * REST API / GraphQL
  * Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase

2. SAME BACKEND FOR BOTH
------------------------
- Both Mobile App + Web App can use the SAME backend.
- Why?
   * Both send requests → Backend API
   * Backend processes → Database → Response
   * Both receive data in JSON / XML format

3. DIFFERENCE IN FRONTEND
-------------------------
- WEB APP FRONTEND
   * Runs in browser
   * Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue
   * Calls backend API using fetch/axios

- MOBILE APP FRONTEND
   * Runs on Android/iOS
   * Built with Kotlin, Swift, Flutter, React Native
   * Calls backend API using HTTP libraries (Retrofit, Alamofire, axios)

4. FLOW EXAMPLE
---------------
[User Action] → [Frontend (Web/Mobile)] 
→ API Request (https://api.myapp.com/login) 
→ [Backend Server] → [Database] 
→ Response (JSON) 
→ Back to Frontend → Shown to User

===========================================
   FINAL ANSWER
===========================================
- Backend is the SAME for both Web App + Mobile App.
- Only the frontend is different.
- One backend can power multiple frontends (Web, Mobile, Desktop).
