===============================
        WHAT IS APP DEVELOPMENT?
===============================

App Development = The process of creating software applications 
for devices such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, or the web.

It has 3 main categories:
1. Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, Cross-Platform)
2. Web Apps (Run in browser, look like apps)
3. Desktop Apps (Windows, macOS, Linux)


===============================
       FULL APP DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
===============================

STEP 1: PLANNING
----------------
- Define the idea & purpose of the app
- Identify target users
- List main features (MVP)
- Create flowchart / wireframes

STEP 2: UI/UX DESIGN
--------------------
- Design user interface and experience
- Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch
- Focus on usability, color, typography, icons

STEP 3: FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT (User Side)
----------------------------------------
- What users see and interact with
- Mobile: Android (Java, Kotlin), iOS (Swift), Flutter/React Native
- Desktop: Electron, .NET, JavaFX
- Web App: HTML, CSS, JavaScript + React, Angular, Vue

STEP 4: BACKEND DEVELOPMENT (Server Side)
-----------------------------------------
- Handles app logic, database, and security
- Languages: Node.js, PHP, Python, Java, C#
- Frameworks: Express, Django, Spring, Laravel
- Functions: Login, APIs, Payments, Notifications

STEP 5: DATABASE
----------------
- Store and manage user data
- SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Firebase, CouchDB

STEP 6: TESTING
---------------
- Check for bugs and crashes
- Functional testing (do features work?)
- Performance testing (is it fast?)
- Security testing (is it safe?)

STEP 7: DEPLOYMENT
------------------
- Mobile Apps: Publish to Google Play Store / Apple App Store
- Web Apps: Host on Netlify, Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean
- Desktop Apps: Package (.exe, .dmg) and distribute

STEP 8: MAINTENANCE
-------------------
- Fix bugs
- Release updates
- Add new features
- Monitor user feedback


===============================
       FINAL FLOW (SUMMARY)
===============================
Idea → Design → Frontend → Backend → Database → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
