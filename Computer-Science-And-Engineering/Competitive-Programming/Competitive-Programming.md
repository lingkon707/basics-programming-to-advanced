# Competitive Programming

## 📌 What is Competitive Programming?
Competitive Programming (CP) is a **mind sport** where programmers solve well-defined algorithmic problems within a limited time. It tests skills in **problem-solving, data structures, algorithms, mathematics, and coding efficiency**.

## 🎯 Goals of CP
- Improve **problem-solving skills**  
- Learn **optimization & efficiency**  
- Sharpen **logical & analytical thinking**  
- Prepare for **coding interviews** and **real-world problem-solving**  
- Compete in **contests** to rank globally  

## 🛠️ Key Components
1. **Problem Statement** – Clearly defined input, constraints, and output.  
2. **Input/Output** – Fast I/O handling for large test cases.  
3. **Constraints** – Decide whether brute force or optimized algorithms are required.  
4. **Time & Space Complexity** – Core of CP efficiency.  
5. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – The backbone of CP.

## 🔑 Important Topics
- **Mathematics** – Number theory, combinatorics, probability  
- **Algorithms** – Sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph theory, greedy, divide & conquer  
- **Data Structures** – Arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, heaps, hashmaps, segment trees  
- **Advanced Concepts** – String algorithms, bit manipulation, computational geometry
