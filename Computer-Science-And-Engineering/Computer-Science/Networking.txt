Computer Networking (CSE)

1. Overview:
- Computer Networking is the **practice of connecting multiple computers and devices** to share resources, data, and services.
- Enables **communication, data transfer, and resource sharing** across local or global networks.

2. Types of Networks:
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small geographic area, e.g., home, office.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large geographic areas, e.g., the Internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Covers a city or campus.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Very small network for personal devices, e.g., Bluetooth.
- **WLAN (Wireless LAN):** Wireless local network using Wi-Fi.

3. Network Topologies:
- **Bus:** All devices share a single communication line.
- **Star:** Devices connected to a central hub/switch.
- **Ring:** Devices connected in a circular chain.
- **Mesh:** Devices interconnected with multiple paths.
- **Hybrid:** Combination of two or more topologies.

4. Network Devices:
- **Router:** Connects different networks and forwards data packets.
- **Switch:** Connects devices in a LAN and forwards data based on MAC addresses.
- **Hub:** Broadcasts data to all devices in a network.
- **Access Point (AP):** Connects wireless devices to a wired network.
- **Firewall:** Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **Modem:** Converts signals for transmission over different mediums.

5. Network Protocols:
- **TCP/IP:** Standard protocol for Internet communication.
- **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for web browsing.
- **FTP/SFTP:** File transfer protocols.
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP:** Email communication protocols.
- **DNS:** Domain Name System maps domain names to IP addresses.

6. IP Addressing:
- **IPv4:** 32-bit addresses, e.g., 192.168.1.1
- **IPv6:** 128-bit addresses, e.g., 2001:0db8::1
- **Public vs Private IPs:** Public for internet, private for internal networks.
- **Subnetting:** Dividing network into smaller sub-networks for efficient management.

7. Network Models:
- **OSI Model (7 layers):** Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.
- **TCP/IP Model (4 layers):** Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access.

8. Network Security:
- **Encryption:** Protects data during transmission.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Secure remote connection.
- **Firewalls & IDS/IPS:** Monitor and prevent attacks.
- **Authentication & Access Control:** Ensures only authorized users can access network resources.

9. Wireless Networking:
- **Wi-Fi:** Wireless LAN technology using IEEE 802.11 standards.
- **Bluetooth:** Short-range wireless communication.
- **5G/4G Cellular Networks:** Mobile communication networks.

10. Network Services:
- **File Sharing:** Access files across devices.
- **Printing Services:** Shared network printers.
- **Email Services:** Centralized communication system.
- **Cloud Services:** Internet-based storage and applications.

11. Summary:
- Networking connects computers to **share resources, communicate, and access services** efficiently.
- Understanding networking is critical in **software development, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and IoT**.
