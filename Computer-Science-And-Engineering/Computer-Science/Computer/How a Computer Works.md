# How a Computer Works

1. **Input**
   - Devices like keyboard, mouse, scanner, or microphone send data to the computer.
   - Example: Pressing a key on the keyboard sends a signal representing that character.

2. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**
   - The “brain” of the computer that performs calculations and executes instructions.
   - **Components:**
     - **Control Unit (CU):** Directs data flow between CPU, memory, and peripherals.
     - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs math operations and logical comparisons.
     - **Registers:** Temporary storage for data being processed.
   - **Process:**
     1. Fetch → Get instruction from memory
     2. Decode → Understand what the instruction requires
     3. Execute → Perform the operation
     4. Store → Save result in memory if needed

3. **Memory**
   - **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary storage for data and programs in use.
   - **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Permanent storage for essential instructions like booting.
   - **Cache:** Super-fast memory inside CPU for frequently used data.

4. **Storage**
   - Hard drives (HDD/SSD) store data permanently.
   - Stores the operating system, applications, and user files.

5. **Output**
   - Devices like monitor, printer, or speakers display results of processed data.
   - Example: CPU processes keystrokes and shows letters on the screen.

6. **Motherboard**
   - Connects CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals.
   - Provides communication pathways (buses) between components.

7. **Software**
   - Programs and operating systems tell hardware **what to do**.
   - Examples: Windows, Linux, Microsoft Word, Chrome.

8. **Process Overview**
   - Input → CPU fetches & processes → Memory stores temporary data → Output displayed → Repeat.
   - All operations are based on binary code (0s and 1s) processed at incredible speeds.

**Summary:**  
A computer works by taking input, processing it using the CPU and memory, storing/retrieving data from storage, and producing output, all guided by software instructions. Everything happens in a matter of milliseconds, making modern computers incredibly fast and efficient.
