CSE-Friendly EEE Cheat Sheet

1. Basic Electrical Concepts




---

Ohm's Law: V = I * R

Power: P = V * I

Series Circuits: R_total = R1 + R2 + ...

Parallel Circuits: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ...


2. Digital Electronics




---

Number Systems:

Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal


Logic Gates:

AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR


Combinational Circuits: circuits without memory (e.g., adders, multiplexers)

Sequential Circuits: circuits with memory (e.g., flip-flops, counters)

Microprocessor Basics: CPU, memory, input/output ports


3. Electronic Components




---

Resistors: limit current

Capacitors: store energy temporarily

Diodes: allow current in one direction

LEDs: light-emitting diodes

Transistors: switch or amplify current

Relays: electrically operated switch

Sensors: temperature, light, motion, etc.


4. Signals and Systems




---

Analog vs Digital Signals

ADC: Analog-to-Digital Converter

DAC: Digital-to-Analog Converter

Sampling: converting analog signals to digital


5. Practical Skills




---

Using a multimeter: measure voltage, current, resistance

Breadboard circuits: test components without soldering

Arduino/Raspberry Pi basics: control LEDs, motors, sensors

Embedded programming: C/C++ for microcontrollers


6. Focus Areas for Software Engineers
