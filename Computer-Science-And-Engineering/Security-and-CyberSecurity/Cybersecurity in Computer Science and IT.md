# Cybersecurity in Computer Science and IT

Cybersecurity is the practice of **protecting computers, networks, programs, and data** from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. Itâ€™s critical in the digital era due to increasing cyber threats.

---

## 1. **Goals of Cybersecurity**
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Integrity:** Protecting data from being altered or tampered with.
- **Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.
- Often summarized as the **CIA Triad**.

## 2. **Types of Cyber Threats**
- **Malware:** Malicious software like viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware.
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent emails/websites to steal credentials.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS):** Overloading systems to make them unavailable.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** Intercepting communications between two parties.
- **SQL Injection / XSS:** Exploiting web applications to gain access to data.
- **Zero-day Exploit:** Attacks using unknown vulnerabilities.
- **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people into revealing confidential info.

## 3. **Cybersecurity Domains**
1. **Network Security**
   - Protects data in transit.
   - Uses firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPNs, and secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH, TLS).

2. **Application Security**
   - Securing software from vulnerabilities.
   - Techniques: code reviews, penetration testing, secure coding practices.

3. **Information Security**
   - Protects data at rest, in transit, and in use.
   - Encryption (AES, RSA), access control, and data masking.

4. **Endpoint Security**
   - Protects devices like computers, mobile phones, and IoT devices.
   - Antivirus, anti-malware, and device management solutions.

5. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
   - Ensures proper user authentication and authorization.
   - Methods: passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication (MFA).

6. **Cloud Security**
   - Protecting data and services hosted in cloud environments.
   - Focuses on access control, encryption, and secure APIs.

7. **Operational Security (OpSec)**
   - Policies, procedures, and processes to protect critical data.
   - Includes incident response planning and business continuity.

## 4. **Cybersecurity Technologies**
- **Firewalls:** Monitor and filter incoming/outgoing traffic.
- **Antivirus/Antimalware:** Detect and remove malicious software.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Detect and respond to attacks.
- **Encryption:** Protect data using cryptographic methods.
- **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM):** Monitor logs and detect anomalies.
- **VPNs:** Secure communication over public networks.

---

## 5. **Cybersecurity Measures**
- Keep systems and software up-to-date (patching vulnerabilities).
- Use strong, unique passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Backup important data regularly.
- Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.
- Monitor networks for suspicious activity.
- Implement least privilege principle (give only necessary access).

---

## 6. **Cybersecurity Practices in CSE**
- Secure software development (DevSecOps).
- Network hardening (firewalls, segmentation, monitoring).
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing.
- Digital forensics and incident response.
- Compliance with standards (ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA).

---

## 7. **Emerging Trends**
- **AI & Machine Learning in Security:** Detect anomalies and predict threats.
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Never trust, always verify users/devices.
- **IoT Security:** Securing connected devices.
- **Cloud Security Automation:** Automated monitoring and response.
- **Cyber Threat Intelligence:** Real-time information on emerging threats.

---

## 8. **Career Paths in Cybersecurity**
- Security Analyst / Engineer
- Ethical Hacker / Penetration Tester
- Security Architect
- Incident Responder / Forensics Expert
- Cloud Security Specialist
- Cybersecurity Researcher

## Summary
Cybersecurity is a **critical field in CSE** focused on protecting systems, networks, and data from attacks.  
It combines **technology, policies, and human awareness**, with continuous monitoring and adaptation to defend against evolving threats.  
The goal is to maintain **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of digital assets.
