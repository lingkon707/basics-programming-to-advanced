# Human Factors in Cybersecurity

1. **Weak Passwords**
   - Using simple or reused passwords across accounts.
   - Failing to update passwords regularly.

2. **Phishing and Social Engineering**
   - Falling for fake emails, links, or calls that trick users into giving sensitive information.
   - Being manipulated by attackers exploiting trust.

3. **Careless Handling of Data**
   - Sharing confidential data over insecure channels.
   - Leaving sensitive documents or devices unattended.

4. **Lack of Security Awareness**
   - Ignorance of cybersecurity best practices.
   - Not recognizing potential threats or suspicious activity.

5. **Insider Threats**
   - Employees intentionally or unintentionally compromising security.
   - Can be due to disgruntlement, negligence, or lack of training.

6. **Improper Use of Devices**
   - Using personal devices for work without security measures.
   - Downloading unauthorized software or apps.

7. **Failure to Update Systems**
   - Ignoring software updates, patches, and security fixes.
   - Leaving systems exposed to known vulnerabilities.

8. **Over-reliance on Technology**
   - Assuming antivirus or firewall alone will protect them.
   - Neglecting safe practices like two-factor authentication.

9. **Poor Handling of Credentials**
   - Writing passwords down, sharing accounts, or storing them insecurely.
   - Using shared accounts without tracking usage.

10. **Neglecting Physical Security**
    - Leaving devices unlocked or unmonitored.
    - Allowing unauthorized personnel into secure areas.

11. **Shadow IT**
    - Using unapproved applications, cloud services, or devices.
    - Introduces unknown vulnerabilities.

12. **Human Error in Configuration**
    - Misconfiguring servers, firewalls, or access controls.
    - Accidentally exposing sensitive data publicly.

**Summary:**  
Human factors are often the **weakest link in cybersecurity**.  
Even with strong technology, careless or uninformed actions by users can lead to security breaches.  
Addressing these factors requires **awareness training, policies, and monitoring**.
