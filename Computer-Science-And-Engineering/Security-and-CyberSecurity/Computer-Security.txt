Computer Security

1. Overview:
Computer Security refers to the **protection of computer systems and networks** from theft, damage, unauthorized access, and disruption of services. It ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad)** of data.

2. Goals of Computer Security:
- **Confidentiality** – Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity** – Ensure data is accurate and not tampered with.
- **Availability** – Ensure resources are available to authorized users when needed.
- **Authentication** – Verify identity of users and systems.
- **Authorization** – Control access rights to resources.
- **Non-repudiation** – Prevent denial of performing an action.

3. Types of Threats:
- **Malware** – Viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware.
- **Phishing** – Fraudulent attempts to steal sensitive data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Overloading systems to make them unavailable.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** – Intercepting communication between parties.
- **SQL Injection & XSS** – Web application attacks.
- **Social Engineering** – Exploiting human trust to gain confidential information.

4. Security Measures:
- **Antivirus & Anti-malware Software** – Detects and removes malicious software.
- **Firewalls** – Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic.
- **Encryption** – Converts data into unreadable format for unauthorized users.
- **Access Control** – Limits access based on roles and permissions.
- **Secure Passwords & Authentication** – Multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics.
- **Regular Updates/Patches** – Fixes vulnerabilities in software and OS.

5. Cryptography:
- **Symmetric Key Encryption** – Same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Key Encryption** – Public and private key pairs (e.g., RSA).
- **Hash Functions** – Data integrity verification (e.g., SHA-256).

6. Network Security:
- Protects **LAN, WAN, Wi-Fi** networks from unauthorized access.
- Implements **VPNs, IDS/IPS, secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH)**.
- Monitors traffic for anomalies and intrusions.

7. Physical Security:
- Protects hardware and storage devices.
- Includes **locks, surveillance, controlled access**, and backups.

8. Security Policies:
- Guidelines for employees and systems to ensure secure operations.
- Includes **acceptable use policy, data protection policy, incident response plan**.

9. Emerging Trends:
- **Cloud Security** – Protecting cloud-based services and data.
- **IoT Security** – Securing Internet of Things devices.
- **Zero Trust Security** – Continuous verification for all users and devices.
- **AI & ML in Security** – Detecting anomalies and predicting threats.

Summary:
Computer Security ensures that **data, applications, and networks** are protected against threats while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Effective security combines **technology, policies, and user awareness**.
