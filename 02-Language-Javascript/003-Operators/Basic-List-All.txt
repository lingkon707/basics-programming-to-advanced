Arithmetic Operators:
Used for mathematical calculations.
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus - returns the remainder of a division)
** (Exponentiation)
++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)


Assignment Operators:
Used to assign values to variables.
= (Assignment)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
**= (Exponentiation and assign)


Comparison Operators:
Used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false).
== (Loose equality - compares value only)
=== (Strict equality - compares value and type)
!= (Loose inequality)
!== (Strict inequality)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)


Logical Operators:
Used to combine or manipulate boolean values.
&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)


Bitwise Operators:
Perform operations on the binary representation of numbers.
& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left Shift)
>> (Sign-propagating Right Shift)
>>> (Zero-fill Right Shift)


Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator):
A shorthand for an if-else statement.
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse


String Operator:
+ (Concatenation - used to join strings)


Type Operators:
typeof (Returns the data type of a variable)
instanceof (Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor)
