An iterable is any object that can be looped over with constructs like:

for...of
spread operator (...)
destructuring
Array.from()

ðŸ‘‰ For an object to be iterable, it must implement the Symbol.iterator method, which returns an iterator.

Examples of built-in iterables:

Arrays
Strings
Maps
Sets
TypedArrays
arguments object
DOM collections (like NodeList)
