ðŸ‘‰ Summary:
Use iterables when you want to access items one by one in a flexible, standardized way â€” especially with loops, spreads, destructuring, and conversions. They make your code cleaner and more powerful when handling sequential data.

âœ… Summary:

Iterable â†’ defines [Symbol.iterator] â†’ gives an iterator.

Iterator â†’ has next() â†’ returns { value, done }.

Built-ins (Array, String, Map, Set) already have iterators.

You can make your own iterators with custom logic or use generators for simplicity.
