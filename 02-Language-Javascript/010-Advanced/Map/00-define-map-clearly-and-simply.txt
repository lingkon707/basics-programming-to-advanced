What is map() in JavaScript?

The map() method is a built-in array function in JavaScript.
It is used to transform each element of an array and create a new array with the results.

ðŸ‘‰ Important points:

It does not change the original array.

It always returns a new array of the same length.

You give it a function (callback) that runs on every element.

Basic Syntax
array.map(function(element, index, array) {
  // return new value for this element
})


element â†’ current item in the array

index â†’ position of the item (0, 1, 2, â€¦)

array â†’ the whole array being processed
