** Pro Tip: Start small!
Learn factorial, sum, reverse string, Fibonacci first.
Then move to arrays, nested objects, menus, comments.
After that, try real-world recursion in JS projects.

## Recursion teaches you divide & conquer thinking:
Break big problems into smaller subproblems
Solve the small problems
Combine the answers

## When You Face Nested or Repetitive Problems
Any problem where the depth is unknown or variable is perfect for recursion.
Examples:
Searching in a nested student database
Traversing a menu or folder structure
