  1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Encapsulate related data and functions within objects to create a clear boundary.
   - Use private and public access modifiers to control the visibility of properties and methods.
   - Encapsulation helps in organizing code, reducing dependencies, and enhancing maintainability.

2. **Inheritance:**
   - Utilize inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes that share common properties and methods.
   - Avoid deep class hierarchies and prefer composition when appropriate to prevent the issues of "class explosion."
   - Inheritance facilitates code reuse and promotes a more structured approach to designing your application.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Leverage polymorphism to enable objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enhancing flexibility.
   - Implement method overriding to allow derived classes to provide specific implementations of inherited methods.
   - Polymorphism simplifies code by allowing a single interface to be used for various types of objects.

4. **Modularity:**
   - Break down your code into modular, reusable components.
   - Aim for small, focused classes and functions that perform specific tasks.
   - Modular code is easier to test, debug, and maintain.

5. **Readability:**
   - Write clear and self-explanatory code by using meaningful variable and function names.
   - Follow a consistent coding style and adhere to best practices.
   - Prioritize readability over clever tricks to ensure that your code is easy to understand for yourself and others.

Remember that JavaScript's prototypal nature provides a unique twist on OOP, and concepts like prototypal inheritance may differ from classical languages. Always consider the specific requirements of your project and choose the OOP principles that best suit your needs.
