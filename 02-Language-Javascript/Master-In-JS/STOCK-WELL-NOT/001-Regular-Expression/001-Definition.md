Regular Expressions
A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data. A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types. To use RegExp in JavaScript either we use RegExp constructor or we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. We can create a pattern in two ways.

To declare a string we use a single quote, double quote a backtick to declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y.

RegExp parameters
A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag.

Pattern
A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which some sort of similarity. For instance the word spam in an email could be a pattern we are interested to look for in an email or a phone number format number might be our interest to look for.

Flags
Flags are optional parameters in a regular expression which determine the type of searching. Let us see some of the flags:

g: a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text
i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase)
m: multilin
