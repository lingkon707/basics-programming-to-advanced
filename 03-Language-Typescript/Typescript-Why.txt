Reasons to Use TypeScript in 2021:

1. **Static Typing:**
   - TypeScript adds a static typing layer to JavaScript, catching potential errors during development and improving code reliability.

2. **Enhanced Developer Experience:**
   - With features like code completion, better IntelliSense, and improved refactoring tools, TypeScript enhances the overall developer experience.

3. **Early Error Detection:**
   - Detecting errors during development rather than at runtime helps prevent bugs and promotes more robust code.

4. **Improved Code Readability:**
   - Type annotations make code more self-documenting, improving readability and making it easier for developers to understand and maintain codebases.

5. **Ecosystem Support:**
   - TypeScript has gained widespread adoption, and major libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue provide TypeScript support, contributing to a richer ecosystem.

6. **Code Navigation and Exploration:**
   - TypeScript enables better navigation through codebases and exploration of APIs, making it easier to understand large projects.

7. **Refactoring Safely:**
   - TypeScript's static analysis allows for safer and more efficient refactoring, reducing the likelihood of introducing subtle bugs during code changes.

8. **Better Collaboration:**
   - Type information serves as documentation that aids collaboration between team members by providing clear expectations for function parameters and return types.

9. **Compatibility with JavaScript:**
   - Existing JavaScript code can be gradually migrated to TypeScript, allowing for a smooth transition without requiring a full rewrite.

10. **Tooling Support:**
    - TypeScript is well-supported by modern development tools and integrates seamlessly with popular editors like Visual Studio Code.

11. **Community and Resources:**
    - The TypeScript community is active and supportive, offering a wealth of resources, tutorials, and community-driven tools.

12. **Advanced Features:**
    - TypeScript introduces advanced features like interfaces, generics, and union types, providing developers with powerful tools for creating scalable and maintainable applications.

13. **Language Server Protocol (LSP):**
    - TypeScript's Language Server Protocol enables integration with various IDEs, ensuring consistent and feature-rich language support across different environments.

14. **Better Code Quality:**
    - Type checking helps maintain a higher level of code quality, reducing runtime errors and contributing to a more stable application.

15. **Future-Proofing:**
    - As the JavaScript ecosystem evolves, TypeScript's statically typed nature positions it well for the future, aligning with the trend toward more robust and predictable software development.

Using TypeScript in 2021 and beyond provides developers with a powerful set of tools to create scalable, maintainable, and reliable applications.
