Good question 👍

If you install Linux instead of (or alongside) Windows 10, the setup process and "best practices" change depending on whether you want Linux only or a dual-boot system.

🔹 Option 1: Linux Only (replace Windows)

1. Choose a distro (beginner-friendly):

Ubuntu (most popular, big community)

Linux Mint (Windows-like interface, very easy)

Fedora (modern, cutting edge)

Pop!_OS (great for developers & NVIDIA GPUs)



2. Download ISO → from official distro site.


3. Create Bootable USB → Use Rufus (Windows) or dd/balenaEtcher (Linux/macOS).


4. Install: Boot from USB → Erase Windows partitions → Install Linux.


5. Setup after install:

Run updates: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

Install drivers (GPU, Wi-Fi, etc.) → often automatic.

Install apps via Software Center or terminal (e.g., sudo apt install vlc).

🔹 Option 2: Dual Boot (Windows + Linux)

1. Shrink Windows partition (Disk Management in Windows). Leave free space.


2. Create Linux USB installer.


3. Boot USB → choose “Install alongside Windows” (most installers handle GRUB bootloader).


4. Reboot → GRUB menu will let you pick Windows or Linux at startup.

🔹 Things Linux Does Better

Free, open-source, fewer viruses.

Better resource management → runs faster on older PCs.

Great for coding, servers, security research.

Package managers (apt, dnf, pacman) make software installation easy.

🔹 Things to Consider

Gaming: Windows still has better support, but Linux + Steam Proton now runs ~80–90% of games.

MS Office: Not native (can use LibreOffice, WPS Office, or Office Online).

Hardware: Some printers, webcams, or Wi-Fi adapters may need extra drivers.

Learning curve: If you’ve only used Windows, Linux may feel different at first.
